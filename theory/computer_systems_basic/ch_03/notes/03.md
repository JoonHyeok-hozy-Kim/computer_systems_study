# 3.3 Data Formats

### Terms.) Words
* Due to Intel's origin as a 16-bit architecture that expanded to a 32-bit one...
|word|16-bit data type|
|double word|32-bit data type|
|quad word|64-bit data type|


### Concept) C data types in IA32

* Props.)
  * All pointers are stored as 4-byte double words.
  * IA32 does not support 64-bit data type (long long)
  * Floating-point number forms
    * single-precision : float in C
    * double-precision : double in C
    * extended-precision : GCC's data type

* How Assembly-code suffixes are used.
  * movb : Move byte.
  * movw : Move word.
  * movl : Move double word.


### KEYWORDS
* data types; words; double words; quad words; extended-precision; assembly-code suffix;

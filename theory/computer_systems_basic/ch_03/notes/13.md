# 3.13 x86-64: Extending IA32 to 64 Bits

## 3.13.1 History and Motivation for x86-64
* Concept) IA64
  * A 64-bit system created by Intel, not compatible with IA32
  * Disappeared.

* Concept) x86-64
  * A 64-bit system created by AMD, compatible with IA32
  * Major system currently
  * AKA "AMD64"

* Concept) Intel64
  * A variant of x86-64 created by Intel

## 3.13.2 An Overview of x86-64

### Concept) Major Features of x86-64
* Pointers and long integers are 64 bits long. Integer arithmetic operations support 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit data types.
* The [set of general-purpose registers](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/13.md#concept-set-of-general-purpose-registers-under-x86-64) is expanded from 8 to 16.
* Much of the program state is held in registers rather than on the stack. Integer and pointer procedure arguments (up to 6) are passed via registers. Some procedures do not need to access the stack at all.
* Conditional operations are implemented using [conditional move](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#concept-conditional-move) instructions when possible, yielding better performance than traditional branching code.
* Floating-point operations are implemented using the register-oriented instruction set introduced with SSE version 2, rather than the stack-based approach supported by IA32.


### Concept) Data Types
![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_13_02_data_types.png)
* Desc
  1. Concept) Quad Word
     * 4 times longer than IA32 word(2 bytes).
     * Suffix usage
       * movq, testq, etc
  2. Pointer : 64 bit
     * In principle, gives capability to programs 2^(64) of accessability.
     * In practice, the system supports 2^(48) (= 1 terabyte) size virtual memory.
  3. long : 8 bytes.
  4. long double : 16 bytes
     * Recall that this data type has the 80-bits size.
     * Also, recall that IA32 allocated 12 bytes for this. (96 bits)
     * Thus, x86-64 has comparative advantage in performance.
       * why?) Read/Write operations typically fetch 8/16 bytes at a time.
     * Still, long double is wasteful.
       * why?) Only 10 bytes are actually used while 16 bytes are allocated for this.
       * Thus, **USE ONLY WHEN A PROGRAM REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL PRECISION.**

### Ex.) Assembly-Code Example
* C code
  ```c
  long int simple_l(long int *xp, long int y){
    long int t = *xp + y;
    *xp = t;
    return t;
  }
  ```

* xp at %ebp+8, y at %ebp+12
```assembly
simple_l:
  pushl   %ebp              Save frame pointer (W)
  movl    %esp, %ebp        Create new frame pointer
  movl    8(%ebp), %edx     Retrieve xp (R)
  movl    12(%ebp), %eax    Retrieve y (R)
  addl    (%edx), %eax      Add *xp to get t (R)
  movl    %eax, (%edx)      Store t at xp (W)
  popl    %ebp              Restore frame pointer (R)
  ret                       Return (R)
```

* xp in %rdi, y in %rsi
```assembly
simple_l:
  movq    %rsi, %rax        Copy y (R)
  addq    (%rdi), %rax      Add *xp to get t (R)
  movq    %rax, (%rdi)      Store t at xp (W)
  ret                       Return
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

* Analysis
  * Major differences
    * In x86-64, pointers and long int are 64 bits(quad words).
      * Instructions movq, addq are used.
    * In x86-64, 64-bit version registers are used
    * In x86-64, no stack frame is generated.
    * In x86-64, xp and y are passed in registers rather than on the stack.
  * Result : x86-64 generates less memory references -> Better performance
    * IA32 : 5 reads and 2 writes
    * x86-64 : 2 reads and 1 write

## 3.13.3 Accessing Information
#### Concept) Set of general-purpose registers under x86-64
* Main differences with IA32
   1. The number of registers has been doubled to 16.
   2. All registers are 64 bits long
     * 64-bit extensions of the IA32 registers
       * %rax, %rcx, %rdx, %rbx, %rsi, %rdi, %rsp, and %rbp
     * New registers are named 
       * %r8 ~ %r15
   3. The low-order 32 bits of each register can be accessed directly. 
     * This gives us the familiar registers from IA32
       * %eax, %ecx, %edx, %ebx, %esi, %edi, %esp, and %ebp
     * Eight new 32-bit registers
       * %r8d ~ %r15d.
   4. The low-order 16 bits of each register can be accessed directly, as is the case for IA32. 
     * The word-size versions of the new registers are named %r8w ~ %r15w.
   6. The low-order 8 bits of each register can be accessed directly. 
     * This is true in IA32 only for the first four registers (%al, %cl, %dl, %bl). 
     * The byte-size versions of the other IA32 registers are named %sil, %dil, %spl, and %bpl. 
     * The byte-size versions of the new registers are named %r8b ~ %r15b.
   8. For backward compatibility, the second byte of registers %rax, %rcx, %rdx, and %rbx can be directly accessed by instructions having single-byte operands.
   9. %rsp holds a pointer to the top stack element
   10. There is NO frame pointer register
     * %rbp is available for use as a general-purpose register
   11. [Particular conventions]() are used for passing procedure arguments via registers and for how registers are to be saved and restored during procedure calls
   12. Some forms of [PC-Relative operand addressing in IA32](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#concept-encodings-for-jumps--pc-relative-vs-giving-absolute-address) are supported : [See here.](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/13.md#concept-pc-relative-data-addressing)

### Concept) PC-Relative data addressing

#### Ex.) 
* C code
  ```c
  long int simple_l(long int *xp, long int y){
    long int t = *xp + y;
    *xp = t;
    return t;
  }

  long int gval1 = 567;
  long int gval2 = 763;

  long int call_simple_l(){
    long int z = simple_l(&gval1, 12L);
    return z + gval2;
  }
  ```
* Executable Code
  ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_13_03_ex.jpeg)
  * Desc
    * Line 3 : Stores the address of global variable gval1 in register %rdi.
      * By copying the constant value 0x601020 into register %edi.
      * The upper 32 bits of %rdi are automatically set to zero.
    * Line 5 : Retrieves the value of gval2 and adds it to the value returned by the call to simple_l.
      * Here's the PC-relative addressing
        * The immediate value 0x200ad1 is added to the address of the following instruction to get 
          * 0x200ad1 + 0x400557 = 0x601028


### Concept) Data Movement Instructions
![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_13_03_data_movement.jpeg)
* cf.) *movabsq*
  * Move absolute quad word
    * This instruction can copy a full 64-bit immediate value to its destination register.

### Concept) Arithmetic Instructions
#### Prop) Add suffix 'q' for quad word operations.
* ex)
  * leaq : load effective address
  * incq : increment
  * addq : add
  * salq : arithmetic left shift

#### Prop) Operations that generate N-bit, where N is less than 64, upper bits are filled with zeroes.

#### Ex.) Casting to quad words
* C Code
  ```c
  long int gfun(int x, int y){
    long int t1 = (long) x + y;
    long int t2 = (long) (x + y);
    return t1 | t2;
  }
  ```

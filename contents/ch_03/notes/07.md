# 3.7 Procedures

### Prop.) A procedure call involves in followings
1. Passing data from one part of a program to another.
   * Data are in the form of procedure parameters and return values
2. Passing control from one part of a program to another.
3. Allocating space for the local variables of the procedure on entry
4. Deallocating them on exit

### Prop.) The [program stack](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-program-stack) handles 1, 3, and 4 above.

## 3.7.1 Stack Frame Structure
### Prop.) IA32 machine uses the [program stack](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-program-stack) to...
1. pass procedure arguments
2. store return information
3. save registers for later restoration and for local storage
  

### Concept) Stack Frame
* The portion of the stack allocated for a single procedure call
* Concept) Two Pointers that delimit the topmost stack frame
   1. [Frame Pointer](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/07.md#concept-frame-pointer)
   2. [Stack Pointer](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/07.md#concept-stack-pointer)

#### Concept) Frame Pointer
* Register %ebp serves as the frame pointer
* %ebp points at the bottom most part of the topmost stack frame 


#### Concept) Stack Pointer
* Register %esp serves as the stack pointer
* %esp points at the top most part of the topmost stack frame 
* Stack pointer can move while the procedure is executing
 * Hence, most information is accessed relative to the frame pointer.
   * e.g.) 8(%ebp), 12(%ebp)
* Space allocation and deallocation on the stack
  * Allocation : By decrementing the stack pointer by an appropriate amount
  * Deallocation : By incrementing the stack pointer by an appropriate amount
    * Recall that the stack grows toward lower addresses!!!


#### Tech.) Suppose procedure P(the caller) calls procedure Q(the callee)...
1. The arguments to Q are contained within the stack frame for P.
   * Recall where the input parameters were located at!
     * ex.) 8(%ebp) : offset 8 relative to the frame pointer of Q.
     * ex.) 12(%ebp) : offset 12 relative to the frame pointer of Q.
       * why after?) Recall that  the stack grows toward lower addresses and the stack pointer %esp points to the top element of the stack.
2. The stack frame for Q starts with the saved value of the frame pointer.
   * The value at the frame pointer is the copy of the value at %ebp.
3. Procedure Q uses the stack for any local variables that cannot be stored in registers.
   * Why storing in the stack(memory), instead of registers?
     * Not enough space in register.
     * Variables such as arrays of structures must be accessed by array or structure reference.
     * The address operator ‘&’ is applied to a local variable, and hence we must be able to generate an address for it.
4. When Q returns, the program should resume execution by pushing **return address** onto the stack.
   * Recall that **return address** was stored within P's stack frame!

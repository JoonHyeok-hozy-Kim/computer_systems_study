# 3.7 Procedures

### Prop.) A procedure call involves in followings
1. Passing data from one part of a program to another.
   * Data are in the form of procedure parameters and return values
2. Passing control from one part of a program to another.
3. Allocating space for the local variables of the procedure on entry
4. Deallocating them on exit

### Prop.) The [program stack](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-program-stack) handles 1, 3, and 4 above.

## 3.7.1 Stack Frame Structure
### Prop.) IA32 machine uses the [program stack](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-program-stack) to...
1. pass procedure arguments
2. store return information
3. save registers for later restoration and for local storage
  

### Concept) Stack Frame
* The portion of the stack allocated for a single procedure call
* Concept) Two Pointers that delimit the topmost stack frame
   1. [Frame Pointer](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/07.md#concept-frame-pointer)
   2. [Stack Pointer](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/07.md#concept-stack-pointer)

#### Concept) Frame Pointer
* Register %ebp serves as the frame pointer
* %ebp points at the bottom most part of the topmost stack frame 


#### Concept) Stack Pointer
* Register %esp serves as the stack pointer
* %esp points at the top most part of the topmost stack frame 
* Stack pointer can move while the procedure is executing
 * Hence, most information is accessed relative to the frame pointer.
   * e.g.) 8(%ebp), 12(%ebp)
* Space allocation and deallocation on the stack
  * Allocation : By decrementing the stack pointer by an appropriate amount
  * Deallocation : By incrementing the stack pointer by an appropriate amount
    * Recall that the stack grows toward lower addresses!!!

<br><br>

#### Ex.) Suppose procedure P(the caller) calls procedure Q(the callee)...
1. The arguments to Q are contained within the stack frame for P.
   * Recall where the input parameters were located at!
     * ex.) 8(%ebp) : offset 8 relative to the frame pointer of Q.
     * ex.) 12(%ebp) : offset 12 relative to the frame pointer of Q.
       * why after?) Recall that  the stack grows toward lower addresses and the stack pointer %esp points to the top element of the stack.
2. The stack frame for Q starts with the saved value of the frame pointer.
   * The value at the frame pointer is the copy of the value at %ebp.
3. Procedure Q uses the stack for any local variables that cannot be stored in registers.
   * Why storing in the stack(memory), instead of registers?
     * Not enough space in register.
     * Variables such as arrays of structures must be accessed by array or structure reference.
     * The address operator ‘&’ is applied to a local variable, and hence we must be able to generate an address for it.
4. When Q returns, the program should resume execution by pushing **return address** onto the stack.
   * Recall that **return address** was stored within P's stack frame!

## 3.7.2 Transferring Control
### Concept) **call** instruction
* Def.) An instruction that calls a procedure
  1. It pushes a return address on the stack
     * return address : the address of the instruction immediately following the call in the program.
  2. It jumps to the start of the called procedure
  3. When the called procedure is ended, the execution will resume at the return address
* How to call.
  * Direct call : Given as a label
    ```assembly
   call Label
    ```
  * Indirect call : Given by a * followed by an operand specifier
    ```assembly
   call * Operand
    ```

### Concept) **ret** instruction
* Def.) An instruction that pops an address off the stack and jumps to the indicated location.
* Prop.) Preceding **call** instruction should have stored its return address at the stack pointer prior to the execution of **ret** instruction.
* How to ret
  ```assembly
   ret
  ```


#### Ex.) Simple sum() and main() function
* C code
  ```c
  int accum = 0;

  int sum(int x, int y){
   int t = x + y;
   accum += t;
   return t;
  }

  int main() {
   return sum(1, 3);
  }
  ``` 
* How it works
    1. main() **call**s sum().
    2. The return address of main() pushed to the program stack
    3. Jump to the first address of sum() (0x08048394)
    4. Execute sum()
    5. **ret** instruction at 0x080483a4 pops the value 0x080483e1 from the stack and jumps to this address.
    6. Resume main() after the call.

### Concept) **leave** instruction
* Def.) An instruction that can be used to prepare the stack for returning.
* Prop.) Equivalent to the following.
  ```assembly
  movl %ebp, %esp
  popl %ebp
  ```

## 3.7.3 Register Usage Conventions
### Concept) caller-save registers
* Def.) When procedure Q is called by P, it can overwrite **caller-save registers** without destroying any data required by P.
* Registers : %eax, %edx, %ecx

### Concept) callee-save registers
* Def.) Q must save the values of any of the **callee-saved registers** on the stack before overwriting them, and restore them before returning.
  * why?) P (or some higher-level procedure) may need these values for its future computations.
* Registers : %ebx, %esi, %edi

#### Ex.) Consider the following case
* C code
   ```c
   int P(int x){
      int y = x * x;
      int z = Q(y);
      return y + z;
   }
   ```
* Procedure P computes y before calling Q, but it must also ensure that the value of y is available after Q returns. It can do this by one of two means:
    1. It can store the value of y in its own stack frame before calling Q; when Q returns, procedure P can then retrieve the value of y from the stack. In other words, P, the caller,saves the value.
    2. It can store the value of y in a callee-save register. If Q, or any procedure called by Q, wants to use this register, it must save the register value in its stack frame and restore the value before it returns (in other words, the callee saves the value). When Q returns to P, the value of y will be in the callee-save register, either because the register was never altered or because it was saved and restored.

## 3.7.4 Procedure Example
* C code
  ```c
  int swap_add(int *xp, int *yp){
    int x = *xp;
    int y = *yp;

    *xp = y;
    *yp = x;

    return x + y;
  }

  int caller(){
    int arg1 = 534;
    int arg2 = 1057;
    int sum = swap_add(&arg1, &arg2);
    int diff = arg1 - arg2;

    return sum * diff;
  }
  ```
* In assembly
  * Part 1) caller()
     ```assembly
     caller:
         pushl  %ebp              Save old %ebp
         movl   %esp, %ebp        Set %ebp as frame pointer (prev address of %esp)
         subl   $24, %esp         Allocate 24 bytes on stack (for caller() func)
         movl   $534, -4(%ebp)    Set arg1 to 534
         movl   $1057, -8(%ebp)   Set arg2 to 1057
         leal   -8(%ebp), %eax    Compute &arg2
         movl   %eax, 4(%esp)     Store on stack (4 digits above the stack pointer)
         leal   -4(%ebp), %eax    Compute &arg1
         movl   %eax, (%esp)      Store on stack (directly on the stack pointer)
         call   swap_add          Call the swap_add function
     ```
  * Part 2) swap_add()
     ```assembly
     swap_add:
         pushl  %ebp              Save old %ebp
         movl   %esp, %ebp        Set %ebp as frame pointer (prev address of %esp)
         pushl  %ebx              Save %ebx : Recall the callee-save register!
     ```

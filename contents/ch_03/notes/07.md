# 3.7 Procedures

### Prop.) A procedure call involves in followings
1. Passing data from one part of a program to another.
   * Data are in the form of procedure parameters and return values
2. Passing control from one part of a program to another.
3. Allocating space for the local variables of the procedure on entry
4. Deallocating them on exit

### Prop.) The [program stack](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-program-stack) handles 1, 3, and 4 above.

## 3.7.1 Stack Frame Structure
### Prop.) IA32 machine uses the program stack to...
1. pass procedure arguments
2. store return information
3. save registers for later restoration and for local storage
  

### Concept) Stack Frame
* The portion of the stack allocated for a single procedure call
* Concept) Two Pointers that delimit the topmost stack frame
   1. [Frame Pointer]()
   2. [Stack Pointer]()


#### Concept) Frame Pointer
* Register %ebp serves as the frame pointer
* %ebp points at the beginning (the bottom most part) of the topmost stack frame 


#### Concept) Stack Pointer
* Register %esp serves as the stack pointer
* %esp points at the ending (the top most part) of the topmost stack frame 
* Stack pointer can move while the procedure is executing
 * Hence, most information is accessed relative to the frame pointer.
   * e.g.) 8(%ebp), 12(%ebp)

# 3.13 x86-64: Extending IA32 to 64 Bits

## 3.13.1 History and Motivation for x86-64
* Concept) IA64
  * A 64-bit system created by Intel, not compatible with IA32
  * Disappeared.

* Concept) x86-64
  * A 64-bit system created by AMD, compatible with IA32
  * Major system currently
  * AKA "AMD64"

* Concept) Intel64
  * A variant of x86-64 created by Intel

## 3.13.2 An Overview of x86-64

### Concept) Major Features of x86-64
* Pointers and long integers are 64 bits long. Integer arithmetic operations support 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit data types.
* The set of general-purpose registers is expanded from 8 to 16.
* Much of the program state is held in registers rather than on the stack. Integer and pointer procedure arguments (up to 6) are passed via registers. Some procedures do not need to access the stack at all.
* Conditional operations are implemented using [conditional move](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#concept-conditional-move) instructions when possible, yielding better performance than traditional branching code.
* Floating-point operations are implemented using the register-oriented instruction set introduced with SSE version 2, rather than the stack-based approach supported by IA32.


### Concept) Data Types

* Desc
  1. Concept) Quad Word
     * 4 times longer than IA32 word(2 bytes).
     * Suffix usage
       * movq, testq, etc
  2. Pointer : 64 bit
     * In principle, gives capability to programs 2^(64) of accessability.
     * In practice, the system supports 2^(48) (= 1 terabyte) size virtual memory.
  3. long : 8 bytes.
  4. long double : 16 bytes
     * Recall that this data type has the 80-bits size.
     * Also, recall that IA32 allocated 12 bytes for this. (96 bits)
     * Thus, x86-64 has comparative advantage in performance.
       * why?) Read/Write operations typically fetch 8/16 bytes at a time.
     * Still, long double is wasteful.
       * why?) Only 10 bytes are actually used while 16 bytes are allocated for this.
       * Thus, **USE ONLY WHEN A PROGRAM REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL PRECISION.**

### Ex.) Assembly-Code Example
* C code
  ```c
  long int simple_l(long int *xp, long int y){
    long int t = *xp + y;
    *xp = t;
    return t;
  }
  ```

<table>
<tr>

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

* xp at %ebp+8, y at %ebp+12
```assembly
simple_l:
  pushl   %ebp              Save frame pointer (W)
  movl    %esp, %ebp        Create new frame pointer
  movl    8(%ebp), %edx     Retrieve xp (R)
  movl    12(%ebp), %eax    Retrieve y (R)
  addl    (%edx), %eax      Add *xp to get t (R)
  movl    %eax, (%edx)      Store t at xp (W)
  popl    %ebp              Restore frame pointer (R)
  ret                       Return (R)
```

</td>
<td>

* xp in %rdi, y in %rsi
```assembly
simple_l:
  movq    %rsi, %rax        Copy y (R)
  addq    (%rdi), %rax      Add *xp to get t (R)
  movq    %rax, (%rdi)      Store t at xp (W)
  ret                       Return
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

* Analysis
  * Major differences
    * In x86-64, pointers and long int are 64 bits(quad words).
      * Instructions movq, addq are used.
    * In x86-64, 64-bit version registers are used
    * In x86-64, no stack frame is generated.
    * In x86-64, xp and y are passed in registers rather than on the stack.
  * Result : x86-64 generates less memory references -> Better performance
    * IA32 : 5 reads and 2 writes
    * x86-64 : 2 reads and 1 write

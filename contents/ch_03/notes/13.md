# 3.13 x86-64: Extending IA32 to 64 Bits

## 3.13.1 History and Motivation for x86-64
* Concept) IA64
  * A 64-bit system created by Intel, not compatible with IA32
  * Disappeared.

* Concept) x86-64
  * A 64-bit system created by AMD, compatible with IA32
  * Major system currently
  * AKA "AMD64"

* Concept) Intel64
  * A variant of x86-64 created by Intel

## 3.13.2 An Overview of x86-64

### Concept) Major Features of x86-64
* Pointers and long integers are 64 bits long. Integer arithmetic operations support 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit data types.
* The set of general-purpose registers is expanded from 8 to 16.
* Much of the program state is held in registers rather than on the stack. Integer and pointer procedure arguments (up to 6) are passed via registers. Some procedures do not need to access the stack at all.
* Conditional operations are implemented using [conditional move](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#concept-conditional-move) instructions when possible, yielding better performance than traditional branching code.
* Floating-point operations are implemented using the register-oriented instruction set introduced with SSE version 2, rather than the stack-based approach supported by IA32.

# 3.2 Program Encodings

### Case Study) Compiling C programs in Unix
* Suppose we compile two C programs p1.c and p2.c 
```console
unix> gcc -O1 -o p p1.c p2.c
```
* Interpretation
  * gcc : GCC C compiler which is a default compiler on Linux
  * (option) -01 : Instructs the compiler to apply level-one optimization
    * Prop.) Increasing the level of optimization makes the final program run faster, but at a risk of increased compilation time and difficulties running debugging tools on the code.
    * Prop.) Increasing the level of optimization generates machines codes that more transformations were made from the original source code.
    * Prop.) level-two is desired in practice.

* What happens
    * The gcc command invokes a sequence of programs to turn the source code into executable code.
       1. The C preprocessor expands the source codes to include files(#include) and macros(#define).
       2. The compiler generates assembly-code versions of the two source files having names p1.s and p2.s.
       3. The assembler converts the assembly code into binary **object-code** files p1.o and p2.o.
       4. The linker merges these two object-code files along with code implementing library functions (e.g., printf) and generates the final **executable code** file p.
    * Here, the **object-code** and the **executable code** are two machine codes.
      * **object-code** contains binary representations of all of the instructions, but the addresses of global values are not yet filled in.
      * **executable code** is the exact form of code that is executed by the processor.

## 3.2.1 Machine-Level Code
### Concept) instruction set architecture (ISA)
* Def.) ISA defines the followings
  * the processor state
  * the format of the instructions
  * the effect each of these instructions will have on the state

### Prop.) Two important abstract model for machine-level programming
1. ISA above
    * The processor hardware employ safeguards to ensure that the overall behavior matches the sequential operation dictated by the ISA.
2. virtual address
    * The memory addresses used by a machine-level program are virtual addresses, providing a memory model that appears to be a very large byte array.


### Concept) Parts of the processor state
* **program counter (PC)** indicates the address in memory of the next instruction to be executed.
  * In IA32, called %eip
* The **integer register file** contains eight named locations storing 32-bit values.
* The **condition code registers** hold status information about the most recently executed arithmetic or logical instruction.
* A set of floating-point registers store floating-point data.


### Prop.) Machine code views the memory as simply a large, byte-addressable array.
* Recall that C provides a model in which objects of different data types can be declared and allocated in memory.
  * int, float, unsigned, double, struct, etc
* In machine code, they are just contiguous collections of bytes.

### Prop.) The program memory contains the executable machine code for the program.
* Example Contents
  * information required by the operating system
  * a run-time stack for managing procedure calls and returns
  * blocks of memory allocated by the user (when malloc() function is called!)

### Prop.) At any given time, only limited subranges of virtual addresses are considered valid.
* ex)
  * Although the 32-bit addresses of IA32 potentially span a 4-gigabyte range of address values, a typical program will only have access to a few megabytes.

## 3.2.2 Code Examples
* C code file : code.c
```C
int accum = 0;

int sum(int x, int y){
  int t = x + y;
  accum += t;
  return t;
}
```

### Tech.) How to generate assembly code with gcc
* Add "-S" option.
```console
unix> gcc -01 -S code.c
```

### Tech.) How to compile and assemble code with gcc
* Add "-c" option.
```console
unix> gcc -01 -c code.c
```
* Then 800 bytes of the file code.o will be generated having hexadecimal representation.


### Concept) disassembler
* Def.) A class of programs that can be used to inspect the contents of machine-code files
* For Linux, use OBJDUMP
```console
unix> objdump -d code.o
```

</p>

* Props.)
  * 17 Hexadecimal byte values
    * Partitioned into groups 1 to 6 bytes each
    * Each of these groups is a single instruction (corresponding assembly language on the right)
  * IA32 instructions can range in length from 1 ~ 15 bytes.
    * More commonly used instructions are given smaller numbers.
  * About the instruction format
    * From a given starting position, there is a unique decoding of the bytes into machine instructions.
      * ex.) *pushl %ebp* can start with byte value *55*
  * The disassembler determines the assembly code based purely on the byte sequences in the machine-code file.
  * The disassembler uses a slightly different naming convention for the instructions than does the assembly code generated by gcc.


### Concept) Assembly-code formats : ATT vs Intel   

| AT&T Format (ATT) | Intel Format |

## 3.5.1 Load Effective Address
#### Concept) leal
* A variant of the *movl* instruction.
  * It read from memory to a register, but does NOT reference memory at all.
  * It copies the [effective address](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-type-of-operands-3) to the destination (first operand)
    * i.e.) Load effective address.
* Syntax
  ```assembly
  leal 7(%edx, %edx, 4), %eax
  ```
  * Interpretation
    * Suppose %edx contains value x.
    * Then it means, set %eax to (5x + 7)
* Prop.)
  * Compilers often find clever uses of leal that have nothing to do with effective address computations.
  * The destination operand must be a register.

## 3.5.2 Unary and Binary Operations
#### Concept) Unary Operations
* Prop.) It goes with a single operand serving as both source and destination
  * The operand can be either a register or a memory location.
* Ex. 1)
  ```assembly
  incl (%esp)
  ```
  * Interpretation : Make 4-byte element on the top of the stack (%esp) to be incremented.
  * Similar to C's increment(++) and decrement(--) operators.


#### Concept) Binary Operations
* Prop.) The second operand is used as both a source and a destination
  * The source operand is given first and the destination is the second.
    * First operand can be either an immediate value(register) or a memory location.
    * Second operand can be either an immediate value(register) or a memory location.
    * Two operands cannot be both memory locations.
  * Similar to C's assignment operations such as +=, -=, etc.
* Ex. 1)
  ```assembly
  subl %eax, %edx
  ```
  * Interpretation : Decrement register %edx by the value in %eax.
    * or, "Subtract %eax from %edx"

## 3.5.3 Shift Operations
* Prop.) The shift amount is given first, and the value to shift is given second.
  * Both arithmetic and logical right shifts are possible.
  * The shift amount is encoded as a single byte, since only shift amounts between 0 and 31 are possible 
    * why?) Only the low-order 5 bits of the shift amount are considered.
  * The shift amount is given either as an immediate or in the single-byte register element %cl.
    * Note) Shift is unusual in that only allowing this specific register as operand.
  * The destination operand of a shift operation can be either a register or a memory location.
* Types
  * Left Shift
    * SAL : Fill from the right with zeros. (Identical to SHL)
    * SHL : Fill from the right with zeros. (Identical to SAL)
  * Right Shift
    * SAR : Perform the arithmetic shift (Fill the left with the copies of the sign bit)
    * SHR : Perform the logical shift (Fill the left with zeros)

* Props.)
  * The assembly code instructions occur in a different order than in the C source code.
  * In general, compilers generate code that uses individual registers for multiple program values and moves program values among the registers.

## 3.5.5 Special Arithmetic Operations
![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_05_05_instructions.png)


#### Concept) Full 64-bit Product of Two 32-bit Numbers
* IA32 provides two different “one-operand” multiply instructions to compute the full 64-bit product of two 32-bit values
  * Types
    1. mull : one for unsigned multiplication
    2. imull : one for two’s-complement multiplication
  * Prop.)
    * For both of them, one argument must be in register **%eax**.
    * The other is given as the instruction source operand.
    * The product is then stored in registers %edx and %eax.
      * %edx : high-order 32 bits
      * %eax : low-order 32 bits
    * Although the name imull is used for two distinct multiplication operations, the assembler can tell which one is intended by counting the number of operands.
      * ex.) Let x at 8(%ebp) and y at 12(%ebp)   
        ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_05_05_imull_64.png)
        * Note) Data Location for a Little Endian Machine
          * Consider that low-order 32-bits comes first and then the high-order.
      * Compare the above with [the 32-bit product](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/problems/practice_problems.md#practice-problem-37).


#### Concept) Integer Division / Modulus Operations
* Integer division and modulus operations operations are provided by the single-operand divide instructions similar to the single-operand multiply instructions.
* Integer Division
  * idivl
    * A signed division instruction.
    * Takes as dividend the 64-bit quantity in registers %edx (high-order 32 bits) and %eax (low-order 32 bits).
    * The divisor is given as the instruction operand.
      * Term.) (dividend) / (divisor)
    *  The instruction stores the quotient(몫) in register %eax and the remainder(나머지) in register %edx.
* ex1) Using "movl 8(%ebp), %edx" / "sarl $31, %edx"
  ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_05_05_idivl.png)
  * Explanation
    * "movl 8(%ebp), %edx" and "sarl $31, %edx" have the combined effect of setting register %edx to either all zeros or all ones depending on the sign of x.
    * Finally, we have the combined registers %edx and %eax storing a 64-bit, sign-extended version of x.
* ex2) Using cltd instruction for the sign extension

## 3.5.1 Load Effective Address
#### Concept) leal
* A variant of the *movl* instruction.
  * It read from memory to a register, but does NOT reference memory at all.
  * It copies the [effective address](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-type-of-operands-3) to the destination (first operand)
    * i.e.) Load effective address.
* Syntax
  ```assembly
  leal 7(%edx, %edx, 4), %eax
  ```
  * Interpretation
    * Suppose %edx contains value x.
    * Then it means, set %eax to (5x + 7)
* Prop.)
  * Compilers often find clever uses of leal that have nothing to do with effective address computations.
  * The destination operand must be a register.

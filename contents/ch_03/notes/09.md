# 3.9 Heterogeneous Data Structures

## 3.9.1 Structures

### Concept) C's *struct* data structure
* Def.) A data type that groups objects of possibly different types into a single object
* Props.) 
  * All of the components of a structure are stored in a contiguous region of memory.
  * A pointer to a structure is the address of its first byte.
  * The compiler maintains information about each structure type indicating the **byte offset** of each field.

### Ex.) struct Declaration
* In C declaration
  ```c
  struct rec {
    int i;
    int j;
    int a[3];
    int *p;
  }
  ```
* In memory rec is stored as...

#### Tech.) Operations
1. Copy i to j
   * In C
     ```c
     void member_copy(struct rec *r){
         r->j = r->i;
     }
     ```
   * In assembly
     * Assume *r* is in %edx
     ```assembly
     movl   %edx, %eax
     movl   %eax, 4(%edx)
     ```
2. Generate the pointer value &(r->a[1])
   * In C
     ```c
     int* generate_pointer(struct rec *r){
         return &(r->a[1]);
     }
     ```
   * In assembly
     * Assume *r* is in %eax and *i* is in %edx
     ```assembly
     leal   8(%edx, %eax, 4), %eax    Set %eax to &(r->a[i])
     ```
3. Assign a pointer value
   * In C
     ```c
     void assign_pointer(struct rec *r){
         r->p = r->a[r->i + r->j];
     }
     ```
   * In assembly
     * Assume *r* is in %edx
     ```assembly
     movl   4(%edx), %eax           Get r->j
     addl   (%edx), %eax            Add r->i
     leal   8(%edx, %eax, 4), %eax  Compute &(r->a[r->i + r->j])
     movl   %eax, 20(%edx)          Store in r->p
     ```

## 3.9.2 Unions

### Concept) C's *union* data structure
* Def.) A data type that allows a single object to be referenced according to multiple types.
* Props.)
  * The syntax of union is identical to struct
  * The semantics of union is different from struct
    1. Every field of a union can be referenced with the pointer of the union.
    2. Overall size of a union equals the maximum size of any of its fields.

#### Ex.) struct vs union

<table>
<tr>
<td>Struct</td><td>Union</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

```c
struct S3 {
  char c;
  int i[2];
  double v;
}
```

</td>
<td>

```c
union U3 {
  char c;
  int i[2];
  double v;
}
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan='2'>

* Offsets of the fields c, i, and v.

<img src="https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_09_02_union_ex.png"></td></tr></table><br>


#### Ex.) union can reduce the memory usage

<table><tr><td>Struct</td><td>Union</td><td>Union(improved)</td></tr><tr><td>

```c
struct NODE_S {
  struct NODE_S *left;
  struct NODE_S *right;
  double data;
}
```

</td><td>

```c
union NODE_U {
  struct {
    union NODE_U *left;
    union NODE_U *right;
  } internal;
  double data;
}
```

</td><td>

```c
typedef enum {N_LEAF, N_INTERNAL} nodetype_t;
struct NODE_T {
  nodetype_t type;
  union {
    struct {
      struct NODE_T *left;
      struct NODE_T *right;
    } internal;
    double data;
  } info;
}
```

</td></tr></table><br>


#### Ex.) Usage to access the bit patterns of different data types

<table><tr><td>Target Case</td><td>Identical Code</td><td>In Assembly</td></tr><tr><td>

```c
unsigned float2bit(float f){
  union {
    float f;
    unsigned u;
  } temp;
  temp.f = f;
  return temp.u;
}
```

</td><td>

```c
unsigned copy(unsigned u){
  return u;
}
```

</td><td>

```assembly
movl  8(%ebp), %eax
```

</td></tr></table><br>

## 3.9.3 Data Alignment

### Concept) Alignment Restriction
* Many computer systems place restrictions on the allowable addresses for the primitive data types, requiring that the address for some type of object must be a multiple of some value K (typically 2, 4, or 8).
* Prop.)
  * **Advantage**
    * Memory system performance can be improved
  * **Disadvantage**  
    * Waste of memory
  * IA32 hardware will work correctly regardless of the alignment of data though...
* Ex.)
  * Linux
    * 2-byte data types must have an address that is a multiple of 2.
      * Thus, the least significant bit of the address of short equals 0.
    * Any larger data types must have an address that is a multiple of 4.
      * Thus, the low-order 2 bits of the address must equal 0.
      * long double (10 bytes) data type is allocated 12 bytes.
  * Microsoft Windows
    * Stronger alignment requirement!
    * Any primitive object of K bytes, for K = 2, 4, or 8, must have an address that is a multiple of K.
      * Thus, the address of *long long* and *double* must be multiple of 8!
      * long double (10 bytes) data type is allocated 12 bytes.


### Prop.) Compiler places directives in assembly code indicating the desired alignment for global data.
* Ex.) Ensuring the data following the command, *.align*, will start with an address, multple of 4.
  ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_07_switch_assembly_array.png)


### Prop.) Compiler insert gaps to satisfy the alignment requirements for *struct*.
* Case 1) Inserting gap
  * ex
    ```c
    struct S1 {
      int i;
      char c;
      int j;
    }
    ```
    ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_09_03_insert_gap.png)
* Case 2) Add padding to the end
  * ex
    ```c
    struct S1 {
      int i;
      int j;
      char c;
    }
    ```

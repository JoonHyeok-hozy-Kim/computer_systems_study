# 3.9 Heterogeneous Data Structures

## 3.9.1 Structures

### Concept) C's *struct* data structure
* Def.) A data type that groups objects of possibly different types into a single object
* Props.) 
  * All of the components of a structure are stored in a contiguous region of memory.
  * A pointer to a structure is the address of its first byte.
  * The compiler maintains information about each structure type indicating the **byte offset** of each field.

### Ex.) struct Declaration
* In C declaration
  ```c
  struct rec {
    int i;
    int j;
    int a[3];
    int *p;
  }
  ```
* In memory rec is stored as...

#### Tech.) Operations
1. Copy i to j
   * In C
     ```c
     void member_copy(struct rec *r){
         r->j = r->i;
     }
     ```
   * In assembly
     * Assume *r* is in %edx
     ```assembly
     movl   %edx, %eax
     movl   %eax, 4(%edx)
     ```
2. Generate the pointer value &(r->a[1])
   * In C
     ```c
     int* generate_pointer(struct rec *r){
         return &(r->a[1]);
     }
     ```
   * In assembly
     * Assume *r* is in %eax and *i* is in %edx
     ```assembly
     leal   8(%edx, %eax, 4), %eax    Set %eax to &(r->a[i])
     ```
3. Assign a pointer value
   * In C
     ```c
     void assign_pointer(struct rec *r){
         r->p = r->a[r->i + r->j];
     }
     ```
   * In assembly
     * Assume *r* is in %edx
     ```assembly
     movl   4(%edx), %eax           Get r->j
     addl   (%edx), %eax            Add r->i
     leal   8(%edx, %eax, 4), %eax  Compute &(r->a[r->i + r->j])
     movl   %eax, 20(%edx)          Store in r->p
     ```

## 3.9.2 Unions

### Concept) C's *union* data structure
* Def.) A data type that allows a single object to be referenced according to multiple types.
* Props.)
  * The syntax of union is identical to struct
  * The semantics of union is different from struct
    1. Every field of a union can be referenced with the pointer of the union.
    2. Overall size of a union equals the maximum size of any of its fields.

#### Ex.) struct vs union

<table>
<tr>
<td>Struct</td><td>Union</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

```c
struct S3 {
  char c;
  int i[2];
  double v;
}
```

</td>
<td>

```c
union U3 {
  char c;
  int i[2];
  double v;
}
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan='2'>

* Offsets of the fields c, i, and v.

#### Ex.) union can reduce the memory usage

<table><tr><td>Struct</td><td>Union</td><td>Union(improved)</td></tr><tr><td>

```c
struct NODE_S {
  struct NODE_S *left;
  struct NODE_S *right;
  double data;
}
```

</td><td>

```c
union NODE_U {
  struct {
    union NODE_U *left;
    union NODE_U *right;
  } internal;
  double data;
}
```

</td></tr></table>



### KEYWORDS
* struct; union;

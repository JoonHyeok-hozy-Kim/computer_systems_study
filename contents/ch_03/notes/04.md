# 3.4 Accessing Information

### Concept) 8 Registers in an IA32 CPU   
<p align="left">

</p>


#### Props.) All eight registers can be accessed as either 16s bit or 32 bits
* 8  bits : %al, %cl, %dl, ... , %ah, %ch, %dh, ...
* 16 bits (words) : %ax, %cx, ... , %sp, %bp
* 32 bits (double words) : %eax, %ecx, ... , %esp, %ebp


#### Props.) 8 registers' usage
* For the most part, the first six registers can be considered general-purpose registers with no restrictions placed on their use.
  * Within procedures there are different conventions for saving and restoring the first three registers (%eax, %ecx, and %edx) than for the next three (%ebx, %edi, and %esi).
* The final two registers (%ebp and %esp) contain pointers to important places in the program stack.


#### Props.) Instructions and registers
* The low-order 2 bytes of the first four registers can be independently read or written by the byte operation instructions.
  * Feature supported since 8008 machine.
  * Continued for the compatibility
  * When a byte instruction updates one of these single-byte “register elements,” 
    * The remaining 3 bytes of the register do not change
* The low-order 16 bits of each register can be read or written by word operation instructions.

## 3.4.1 Operand Specifiers

#### Prop.) Most instructions have one or more operands
* Operands specify...
  1. the source values to reference in performing an operation
  2. the destination location into which to place the result

#### Prop.) Source values can be given as constants or read from registers or memory.
#### Prop.) Results can be stored in either registers or memory.

#### Concept) Operand forms in IA32

</p>


#### Concept) Type of operands (3)
1. immediate
   * For constant values
   * Syntax in ATT-format assembly code : $[32-bit int]
     * ex.) $-577 or $0x1f
2. register
   * Denotes the contents of one of the registers [either one of 32 / 16 / 8 bits registers.](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#props-all-eight-registers-can-be-accessed-as-either-16s-bit-or-32-bits)
     1. One of eight 32 bits registers for a double word operation : %eax, %ecx, ...
     2. One of eight 16 bits registers for a word operation : %ax, %cx, ...
     3. One of eight single byte registers for a byte operation : %al, %cl, ...
   * Notations
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_register_notation1.png) : an arbitrary register a
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_register_notation2.png) : the set of registers as an array indexed by register identifiers.
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_register_notation3.png) : a's value with the reference
3. memory reference
   * Def.) We can access memory location according to this computed address(a.k.a effective address)
   * Recall that the memory is a large array of bytes.
   * Notations
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_memory_reference_notation.png) : a reference to the *b*-byte value stored in memory *M* starting at address *Addr*.


#### Concept) General Form of Addressing Modes
* Notation : ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_general_form_of_addressing_modes.png)
  * Interpretation
    * Imm : an immediate offset
    * E_b : a base register
    * E_i : an index register
    * s : a scale factor (must be 1, 2, 4, or 8)
* Usage
  * Referencing elements of arrays.

## 3.4.2 Data Movement Instructions
#### Def.) Copying data from one location to another.

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_02_data_movement_instructions_table.png" width="80%">
</p>
<br>

#### Concept) instruction class
* A group of instructions that performing same operation but with different operand sizes.
* ex.) mov
  * movb : Operate on data of size 1 byte
  * movw : Operate on data of size 2 byte (word)
  * movl : Operate on data of size 4 byte (double word)

#### Prop.) mov class copy their **source values** to their **destinations**.
* Source vs Destination
  * The **source** operand designates a value that is immediate.
    * Thus, stored in a register or in memory.
  * The **destination** operand designates a location that is either a register or a memory address.
* IA32 Restriction
  * A move instruction cannot have both operands refer to memory locations.
  * Thus, copying memory from one memory location to another requires two instructions.
    * i.e.) Two stage operation
      1. Load the source value into a register.
      2. Write the register value to the destination.


#### Ex.) 6 possible combinations of source/destination types

</p>
<br>

#### Concept) Sign/Zero Expansion Instruction
* Why need them?
  * To copy a smaller amount of source data to a larger data location
* Sign Expansion Instruction (movs)
  * The upper bits of the destination are filled in with copies of the most significant bit of the source value.
* Zero Expansion Instruction (movz)
  * The upper bits of the destination are filled in with zeros.

</p>
<br>

#### Concept) Program Stack
* Push/Pop data movement operations move data onto/from it.
* It plays a vital role in the handling of procedure calls.
* In IA32, it is stored in some region of memory.
* By convention, we draw stacks upside down, with the stack “top” shown at the bottom of the figure
* The stack pointer %esp holds the address of the top stack element.
  * The stack top is always considered to be the address indicated by %esp. 
  * Any value stored beyond the stack top is considered invalid.
* Since the stack is contained in the same memory as the program code and other forms of program data, programs can access arbitrary positions within the stack using the standard memory addressing methods.

</p>
<br>

#### Concept) Push data movement operations
* Def.) Push data onto the stack from the source
* ex) 
  ```assembly
  pushl %eax
  ```
* Prop.) Equivalent Operations
  * Push operation is consisted with two operations
    1. Decrementing stack pointer (%esp)
       * why?) 
         * The data type of the source value may vary : 1, 2, 4 byte.
    2. Moving value
  * Thus, it is equivalent to the following.
    ```assembly
    subl $4, %esp
    movl %ebp, (%esp)
    ```
  * However, pushl instruction is encoded in a machine code as a single byte.
    * While, the pair of instructions shown above requires a total of 6 bytes.

</p><br><br>



#### Concept) Pop data movement operations
* Def.) Pop data from the stack and move it to destination
* Syntax)
  ```assembly
  popl %eax
  ```
* Prop.) Equivalent Operations
  * Just like pushl, it can be denoted with Moving the value and Incrementing stack pointer.
    ```assembly
    movl %eax
    addl $4, %esp
    ```

## 3.4.3 Data Movement Example

### Ex 1) 
![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_03_ex1.png)
* How they run?   
0. Body of the procedure starts execution.   
0. Procedure parameters xp and y are stored at offsets 8 an d12 relative to the address in register %ebp.   
1. Read parameter xp from memory and store it in register %edx.
2. Read x into register %eax using register %edx. (Register %eax will be the return value.)
3. Load parameter y into register %ecx.
4. Write the value of %ecx on %edx.

* Props.)
  * “Pointers” in C are simply addresses.
    * Dereferencing a pointer involves copying that pointer into a register and then using this register in a memory reference.
  * Local variables such as x are often kept in registers rather than stored in memory locations.
    * Register access is much faster than memory access.

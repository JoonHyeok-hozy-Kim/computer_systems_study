* Props.) 8 registers' usage
  * For the most part, the first six registers can be considered general-purpose registers with no restrictions placed on their use.
    * Within procedures there are different conventions for saving and restoring the first three registers (%eax, %ecx, and %edx) than for the next three (%ebx, %edi, and %esi).
  * The final two registers (%ebp and %esp) contain pointers to important places in the program stack.

* Props.) Instructions and registers
  * The low-order 2 bytes of the first four registers can be independently read or written by the byte operation instructions.
    * Feature supported since 8008 machine.
    * Continued for the compatibility
    * The remaining 3 bytes of the register do not change when a byte instruction updates one of these single-byte “register elements.” 
  * The low-order 16 bits of each register can be read or written by word operation instructions.

### KEYWORDS
* register;

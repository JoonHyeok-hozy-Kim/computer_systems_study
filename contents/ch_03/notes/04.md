# 3.4 Accessing Information

### Concept) 8 Registers in an IA32 CPU

</p>


#### Props.) All eight registers can be accessed as either 16s bit or 32 bits
* 16 bits (words) : %ax, %cx, ... , %sp, %bp
* 32 bits (double words) : %eax, %ecx, ... , %esp, %ebp


#### Props.) 8 registers' usage
* For the most part, the first six registers can be considered general-purpose registers with no restrictions placed on their use.
  * Within procedures there are different conventions for saving and restoring the first three registers (%eax, %ecx, and %edx) than for the next three (%ebx, %edi, and %esi).
* The final two registers (%ebp and %esp) contain pointers to important places in the program stack.


#### Props.) Instructions and registers
* The low-order 2 bytes of the first four registers can be independently read or written by the byte operation instructions.
  * Feature supported since 8008 machine.
  * Continued for the compatibility
  * When a byte instruction updates one of these single-byte “register elements,” 
    * The remaining 3 bytes of the register do not change
* The low-order 16 bits of each register can be read or written by word operation instructions.

## 3.4.1 Operand Specifiers

#### Prop.) Most instructions have one or more operands
* Operands specify...
  1. the source values to reference in performing an operation
  2. the destination location into which to place the result

#### Prop.) Source values can be given as constants or read from registers or memory.
#### Prop.) Results can be stored in either registers or memory.

#### Concept) Operand forms in IA32

</p>


#### Concept) Type of operands (3)
1. immediate
   * For constant values
   * Syntax in ATT-format assembly code : $[32-bit int]
     * ex.) $-577 or $0x1f
2. register
   * Denotes the contents of one of the registers [either one of 32 / 16 / 8 bits registers.](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#props-all-eight-registers-can-be-accessed-as-either-16s-bit-or-32-bits)
     1. One of eight 32 bits registers for a double word operation : %eax, %ecx, ...
     2. One of eight 16 bits registers for a word operation : %ax, %cx, ...
     3. One of eight single byte registers for a byte operation : %al, %cl, ...
   * Notations
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_register_notation1.png) : an arbitrary register a
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_register_notation2.png) : the set of registers as an array indexed by register identifiers.
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_register_notation3.png) : a's value with the reference
3. memory reference
   * Def.) We can access memory location according to this computed address(a.k.a effective address)
   * Recall that the memory is a large array of bytes.
   * Notations
     * ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_memory_reference_notation.png) : a reference to the *b*-byte value stored in memory *M* starting at address *Addr*.


#### Concept) General Form of Addressing Modes
* Notation : ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_04_01_general_form_of_addressing_modes.png)

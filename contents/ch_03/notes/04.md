</p>

* Props.) All eight registers can be accessed as either 16s bit or 32 bits
  * 16 bits (words) : %ax, %cx, ... , %sp, %bp
  * 32 bits (double words) : %eax, %ecx, ... , %esp, %ebp


* Props.) 8 registers' usage
  * For the most part, the first six registers can be considered general-purpose registers with no restrictions placed on their use.
    * Within procedures there are different conventions for saving and restoring the first three registers (%eax, %ecx, and %edx) than for the next three (%ebx, %edi, and %esi).
  * The final two registers (%ebp and %esp) contain pointers to important places in the program stack.


* Props.) Instructions and registers
  * The low-order 2 bytes of the first four registers can be independently read or written by the byte operation instructions.
    * Feature supported since 8008 machine.
    * Continued for the compatibility
    * When a byte instruction updates one of these single-byte “register elements,” 
      * The remaining 3 bytes of the register do not change
  * The low-order 16 bits of each register can be read or written by word operation instructions.

## 3.4.1 Operand Specifiers

#### Prop.) Most instructions have one or more operands
* Operands specify...
  1. the source values to reference in performing an operation
  2. the destination location into which to place the result

#### Prop.) Source values can be given as constants or read from registers or memory.
#### Prop.) Results can be stored in either registers or memory.

#### Concept) Type of operands (3)
1. immediate
   * For constant values
   * Syntax in ATT-format assembly code : $[32-bit int]
     * ex.) $-577 or $0x1f
2. register
   * Denotes the contents of one of the registers [either one of 32 / 16 bit registers.]()
     * 



### KEYWORDS
* register; operands;

# 3.6 Control

## 3.6.1 Conditional Codes
### Concept) Condition Code
* Def.) A set of single-bit condition code registers describing attributes of the most recent arithmetic or logical operation.
* Props.)
  * Maintained by the CPU
* Types
  1. **CF (Carry Flag)**
     * Desc.) The most recent operation generated a  carry out of the most significant bit. Used to  detect overflow for unsigned operations.
     * Prop.) Matters only if UNSIGNED
     * ex)
       * 1111 + 1000 = 0111 → CF = 1
       * 0000 - 0001 = 1111 → CF = 1
  2. **ZF (Zero Flag)**
     * Desc. : The most recent operation yielded zero.
  3. **SF (Sign Flag)**
     * Desc. : The most recent operation yielded a negative value.
  4. **OF (Overflow Flag)**
     * Desc. : The most recent operation caused a  two’s-complement overflow—either negative or  positive.
     * Prop.) Matters only if TWO'S COMPLEMENT
     * ex)
       * 0111 + 0001 = 1000 → OF = 1 (why? POS + POS  = NEG)
       * 1000 + 1101 = 0101 → OF = 1 (why? NEG + NEG  = POS)

<br>

### Prop.) All instructions [HERE](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/05.md#concept-4-groups-of-operations) except leal cause the condition codes to be set.
* ex.) XOR
  * CF and OF are set to 0.
* ex.) shift operations (SAL, SHL, SAR, SHR)
  * CF is set to the last bit shifted out
  * OF is set to 0.
* ex.) INC / DEC
  * OF and ZF are set but leave CF unchanged

<br>

### Concept) Comparison and Test Instructions (CMP / TEST)

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_01_cmp_test.png" width="60%">
</p>

* Prop.) CMP and TEST instructions set condition codes without altering any other registers.
#### Concept) **CMP Instructions**
  * They behave in the same way as the sub instructions, except that they set the condition codes without updating their destinations.
  * They set the zero flag (ZF) if the two operands are equal.
  * The other flags can be used to determine ordering relations between the two operands.
#### Concept) **TEST Instructions**
  * They behave in the same manner as the and instructions, except that they set the condition codes without altering their destinations.
  * Typically, the same operand is repeated 
    * e.g.) "testl %eax, %eax" to see whether %eax is negative, zero, or positive
      * ex) Usage with [JUMP]() instruction
        * In C language
          ```c
          int dw_loop(int x, int n){
            do {
              x += n;
              n--;
            } while (n > 0);
            return x;
          }
          ```
        * In assembly
          ```assembly
            movl  8(%ebp), %eax
            movl  16(%ebp), %edx
          .L2:
            addl  %edx, %eax
            subl  $1, %edx
            testl %edx, %edx
            jg .L2
          ```
  * One of the operands is a mask indicating which bits should be tested.

## 3.6.2 Accessing the Condition Codes

### Concept) Three Common Ways of Using the Condition Codes
1. We can [SET](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#concept-set-instructions) a single byte to 0 or 1 depending on some combination of the condition codes.
2. We can conditionally [JUMP](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#363-jump-instructions-and-their-encodings) to some other part of the program.
3. We can conditionally transfer data.


### Concept) SET Instructions
* Def.) Set a single byte to 0 or to 1 depending on some combination of the condition codes.
* Types
  ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_02_set_instructions.png)
* Props.)
  * Suffixes denote different conditions and NOT different operand sizes.
  * Destinations : either [one of the eight single-byte register elements](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/04.md#concept-8-registers-in-an-ia32-cpu) or a single-byte memory location
  * Result : Set the destination bytes to either 0 or 1.
    * Thus, to generate a 32-bit result, we must also clear the high-order 24 bits.
      * How
        ```assembly
        cmpl   %eax, %edx
        setl   %al
        movzbl %al, %eax
        ```


#### Concept) Synonyms
* Def.) multiple possible names
* ex.) setg (set greater) <==> setnle (set not less or equal to)
* Prop.) Compilers and disassemblers make arbitrary choices of which names to use.
* Prop.) Use "t = a-b" condition.
  * ex.) sete instruction
    * "a equals b." <==> "t equals 0."
    * Thus, synonym : setz

<br><br>

#### Tech.) Use "t = a-b" to understand the flag determinations
* ex1.) **sete**
  * "a = b" <==> "t = 0"
  * Thus, "ZF = 1"
* ex2.) **setl** (Only for signed!)
  * "a < b" <==> "a-b < 0" <==> "t < 0"
  * Consider the following cases that satisfy "**a < b**"
    1. No overflow (OF = 0)
       * Then, obviously "a < b" → "a-b **< 0**" → SF = 1 (sign flag!)
       * i.e.) OF = 0 / SF = 1
    2. Positive overflow (OF = 1)
       * Then, "a-b > 0" → SF = 0 (The sign of a-b is non-negative.)
         * ex.) 0111 - 1000 = 0111 + 1000 = 1111 > 0
       * i.e.) OF = 1 / SF = 0
    3. Negative overflow (OF = 1)
       * Impossible.
         * why?) Negative overflow takes place only if a < 0 and b > 0 → a > b (x)
  * Thus, by 1 and 2, **SF^OF = 1**
* ex2.) **setb** (Only for unsigned!)
  * "a < b" <==> "a-b < 0" <==> "t < 0"
  * Since a and b are unsigned numbers, if a < b, then there will be CARRY!
    * ex.) 0001 - 0011 = 0001 + 1101 = **1**110
  * Thus, **CF = 1**

## 3.6.3 Jump Instructions and Their Encodings
### Concept) Jump Instruction
* Def.) An instruction that cause the execution to switch to a completely new position in the program.
* Term.) Label : an assembly code that indicates the jump destination
  * ex.) .L1 in the following code.
    ```assembly
      movl $0, %eax
      jmp  .L1
      movl (%eax), %edx
    .L1:
      popl %edx
    ```
* Types
  ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_03_jump_instructions.png)

#### Props.) jmp instructions are unconditional, while others are conditional.
#### Props.) Direct Jump vs Indirect Jump
1. Direct Jump : Jump target is encoded as part of the instruction.
  ```assembly
  jmp .L1
  ```
1. Indirect Jump : The jump target is read from a register or a memory location.
  * Use the value in register %eax as the jump target
    ```assembly
    jmp *%eax
    ```
  * Reads the jump target from memory, using the value in %eax as the read address.
    ```assembly
    jmp *(%eax)
    ```
#### Props.) Conditional Jump Instructions can only be direct.

<br><br>

### Concept) Encodings for Jumps : PC relative vs Giving Absolute Address
#### Concept) PC Relative (Program Counter Relative)
* Def.) Encoding the difference between the address of the target instruction and the address of the instruction immediately following the jump.
* Prop.) 
  * Offsets can be encoded using 1, 2, or 4 bytes.
  * Note that the value of the program counter when performing PC-relative addressing is **the address of the instruction following the jump**, not that of the jump itself.
    * 0xa and 0x17 in the following example!
* Ex.) Consider the following assembly code
  ```assembly
    jle   .L2
  .L5:
    movl  %edx, %eax
    sarl  %eax
    subl  %eax, %edx
    leal  (%edx, %edx, 2), %edx
    testl %edx, %edx
    jg    .L5
  .L2:
    movl  %edx, %eax
  ```
  * Suppose the disassembled version of the object file is generated by the assembler as follows :
    ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_03_pc_relative_ex.png)
    * cf.) Disassembled version of the program after linking.
      ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_03_pc_relative_after_linking.png)

#### Concept) Giving Absolute Address
  * Def.) Using 4 bytes to directly specify the target.

## 3.6.4 Translating Conditional Branches
### Concept) goto code
* Def.) A way to construct C programs that describe the control flow of assembly-code programs, using *goto* statement.
* ex.)
  ```c
  int gotodiff(int x, int y){
    int result;
    if (x >= y){
      goto x_ge_y;
      result = y - x;
      goto done;
    x_ge_y:
      result = x - y;
    done:
      return result;
    }
  }
  ```
* Prop.)
  * Generally considered a bad programming style, due to its difficulty in reading and debugging.


#### Tech.) Representing C's "if-else" statement with goto-code.
```c
t = test_expr;
if (!t){
  goto false;
  // then_statement;
  goto done;
false:
  // else_statement;
done:
  return;
}
```

## 3.6.5 Loops

## 3.6.6 Conditional Move Instructions
#### Concept) Conditional Transfer of Control vs Conditional Transfer of Data
* What are they?)
  * Two ways to implement conditional operations.
    1. Conditional Transfer of Control
       * Def.) The program follows one execution path when a condition holds and another when it does not.
       * Prop.)
         * Advantage : simple and general, 
         * Disadvantage : very inefficient on modern processors.
    2. Conditional Transfer of Data
       * Def.) This approach computes both outcomes of a conditional operation, and then selects one based on whether or not the condition holds.
       * How?) Use [conditional move]()


### Concept) Conditional Move
* Def.) A move instruction that performs the data movement if the specified condition holds.
* Types
  ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_06_type_of_conditional_moves.png)
* Ex.) cmovl (**c**onditional **mov**e **l**ess)
  * Original C code
    ```c
    int absdiff(int x, int y){
      return x < y ? y-x : x-y;
    }
    ```
  * Implementation using conditional assignment
    ```c
    int cmovdiff(int x, int y){
      int tval = y-x;
      int rval = x-y;
      int test = x < y;
      if (test) rval = tval;
      return rval;
    }
    ```
  * Generated assembly code
    ```assembly
      movl  8(%ebp), %ecx
      movl  12(%ebp), %edx
      movl  %edx, %ebx
      subl  %ecx, %ebx
      movl  %ecx, %eax
      subl  %edx, %eax
      cmpl  %ebx, %eax
      cmovl %ebx, %eax
    ```
    * Interpretation
      * cmovl operates only when (%eax) - (%ebx) < 0.
      * l in cmovl indicates "less," not "long."


#### Analysis) Why the Conditional Transfer of Data is more efficient than the one of Controls in modern processors?
* Modern processors achieve high performance through [pipelining]().
  * What is pipelining?
    * An operation that allows instructions to be processed via a sequence of stages, each performing one small portion of the required operations.
    * This approach achieves high performance by overlapping the steps of the successive instructions.
    * To do this requires being able to determine the sequence of instructions to be executed well ahead of time in order to keep the pipeline full of instructions to be executed.
* When encountered conditional jumps(a.k.a branches), processors employ sophisticated branch prediction logic to try to guess whether or not each jump instruction will be followed.
* However, even the most sophisticated branch prediction cannot perfectly predict the exact answer for the branches.
  * ex.) "if (x < y)" : 50%
* As a consequence, the branch misprediction penalty dominates the performance of this function.
  * ex.) Consider [the example above](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#ex-factorial-implementation-2).
    * According to the text book...
      1. When branch is used (Original C code), the time required by the function ranges between around 13 and 57 cycles.
        * i.e.) 13 cycle when the branch easily predicted, 57 when mispredicted.
          * How was the misprediction penalty calculated?
            ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_06_penalty.png)
      2. When the conditional move is used, 14 clock cycles were required regardless of the data being tested.

#### Review) Goto code for the Traditional IA32 assembly vs Conditional Move
* Target
  ```
  v = test-expr ? then-expr : else-expr;
  ```
* Traditional IA32 assembly
  ```
      if (!test-expr)
        goto false;
      v = then-expr;
      goto done;
    false:
      v = else-expr;
  done:
  ```
* Conditional Move
  ```
  v_temp = then-expr;
  v = else-expr;
  t = test-expr;
  if (t) v = v_temp;
  ```


#### Concept) Cases when the conditional move cannot be applied.
1. If one of **then-expression** and **else-expression** could possibly generate an error condition or a side effect...
   * ex)
      ```c
      int c_read(int *xp){
        return (xp ? *xp : 0);
      }
      ```
      * Why problematic?
        * Consider the following assembly code when the conditional move is applied.
          ![](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/images/03_06_06_wrong_ex1.png)
        * Although xp is a null pointer, "testl %edx, %edx" will set the conditional code true for the equality.
          * Thus, the code incurs the null pointer dereferencing error.
2. If either of the two branches causes a side effect...
   * ex)
     ```c
     int lcount = 0;

     int absdiff_se(int x, int y){
      return x < y ? (lcount++, y-x) : x-y;
     }
     ```
      * Why problematic?
        * Conditional move will not operate "lcount++" side effect.
3. Sometimes, using conditional moves also does not always improve code efficiency.
   * What if either the then-expr or the else-expr evaluation requires a significant computation?
   * GCC only uses conditional moves when the two expressions can be computed very easily, for example, with single add instructions.
   * Thus, GCC use conditional control transfers even in many cases where the cost of branch misprediction would exceed even more complex computations.

## 3.6.7 Switch Statements
### Concept) Switch Statement in C
* Def.) a statement that provides a multi-way branching capability based on the value of an integer index.
* Prop.) It utilizes [jump tables](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/06.md#concept-jump-table) for the efficient implementation!
  * Advantage)
    * Takes less time compared to using a long sequence of "if-else" statements.
      * why?) Performing the switch is independent of the number of switch cases!

#### Concept) Jump Table
* Def.) an array where entry i is the address of a code segment implementing the action the program should take when the switch index equals i.

#### Ex.) How switch statement can be translated into extended C and assembly.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>C code with the switch statement</td>
    <td>Translation into extended C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    </td>
    <td>

* Props.)
  * The jump table is implemented using an array, jt.
    * This is an extension of C provided by GCC.
    * Each entry in jt contains the address of a block of code.
    * The operator && is defined for creating pointers for code locations.

  * Assembly code for the pointers to the code locations (.L7 or jt[]) 
    * Props.)
      * Our C code declares the jump table as an array of seven elements, each of which is a pointer to a code location.
      * These elements span values 0–6 of index, corresponding to values 100–106 of n.

    * Props.)
      * Declaration for this array is made within **rodata (Read Only Data)** object-code file.

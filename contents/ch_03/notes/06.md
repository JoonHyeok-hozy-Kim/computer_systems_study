# 3.6 Control

## 3.6.1 Conditional Codes
#### Concept) Condition Code
* Def.) A set of single-bit condition code registers describing attributes of the most recent arithmetic or logical operation.
* Props.)
  * Maintained by the CPU
* Types
  1. **CF (Carry Flag)**
     * Desc.) The most recent operation generated a  carry out of the most significant bit. Used to  detect overflow for unsigned operations.
     * Prop.) Matters only if UNSIGNED
     * ex)
       * 1111 + 1000 = 0111 → CF = 1
       * 0000 - 0001 = 1111 → CF = 1
  2. **ZF (Zero Flag)**
     * Desc. : The most recent operation yielded zero.
  3. **SF (Sign Flag)**
     * Desc. : The most recent operation yielded a negative value.
  4. **OF (Overflow Flag)**
     * Desc. : The most recent operation caused a  two’s-complement overflow—either negative or  positive.
     * Prop.) Matters only if TWO'S COMPLEMENT
     * ex)
       * 0111 + 0001 = 1000 → OF = 1 (why? POS + POS  = NEG)
       * 1000 + 1101 = 0101 → OF = 1 (why? NEG + NEG  = POS)


#### Prop.) All instructions [HERE](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_03/notes/05.md#concept-4-groups-of-operations) except leal cause the condition codes to be set.
* ex.) XOR
  * CF and OF are set to 0.
* ex.) shift operations (SAL, SHL, SAR, SHR)
  * CF is set to the last bit shifted out
  * OF is set to 0.
* ex.) INC / DEC
  * OF and ZF are set but leave CF unchanged


#### Concept) Comparison and Test Instructions (CMP / TEST)

</p>

* Prop.) CMP and TEST instructions set condition codes without altering any other registers.
* Props.) **CMP Instructions**
  * They behave in the same way as the sub instructions, except that they set the condition codes without updating their destinations.
  * They set the zero flag (ZF) if the two operands are equal.
  * The other flags can be used to determine ordering relations between the two operands.
* Props.) **TEST Instructions**
  * They behave in the same manner as the and instructions, except that they set the condition codes without altering their destinations.
  * Typically, the same operand is repeated 
    * e.g.) "testl %eax, %eax" to see whether %eax is negative, zero, or positive
  * One of the operands is a mask indicating which bits should be tested.

# Homework Problems

## 2.55
#### Compile and run the sample code that uses show_bytes (file show-bytes.c) on different machines to which you have access. Determine the byte orderings used by these machines.
* TBD

## 2.56
#### Try running the code for show_bytes for different sample values.

## 2.57
#### Write procedures show_short, show_long, and show_double that print the byte representations of C objects of types short int, long int, and double, respectively. Try these out on several machines.

## 2.58
#### Write a procedure is_little_endian that will return 1 when compiled and run on a little-endian machine, and will return 0 when compiled and run on a big-endian machine. This program should run on any machine, regardless of its word size.

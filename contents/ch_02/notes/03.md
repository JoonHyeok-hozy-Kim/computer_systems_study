</p>

* How?)
  * a w-bit unsigned integer can represent values in range 0 ~ 2^w-1.
  * Thus, value larger that goes over 2^w - 1 (OVERFLOW!) will be discarded.

#### Concept) Modular Addition
* Unsigned integers' addition is identical to mod operation such that
  * (x + y) % (2^w)

#### Concept) overflow
* An arithmetic operation is said to overflow when the full integer result cannot fit within the word size limits of the data type.

#### Tech.) How to verify whether an addition is overflowed or not?
* Overflow is not considered to be an error in C.
* Thus, we should verify its occurrence with following method.
  * For, x + y = s, 
    * If s >= x, no overflow occurred!
  * why?) x + y >= x.

#### Prop.) Abelian Group structure of the Modular addition
* Def.)
  * It has an identity element 0 and every element has an additive inverse.
  * It is commutative and associative.

</p>

* How?)
  * x = 0 : Trivial. 0 + 0 = 0.
  * Consider that (x + (2^w - x)) % 2^w = 2^w % 2^w = 0.

# 2.3 Integer Arithmetic

## 2.3.1 Unsigned Addition
#### Prop.) Addition of a w-bit unsigned integer

</p>

* How?)
  * a w-bit unsigned integer can represent values in range 0 ~ 2^w-1.
  * Thus, value larger that goes over 2^w - 1 (OVERFLOW!) will be discarded.

#### Concept) Modular Addition
* Unsigned integers' addition is identical to mod operation such that
  * (x + y) % (2^w)

#### Concept) overflow
* An arithmetic operation is said to overflow when the full integer result cannot fit within the word size limits of the data type.

#### Tech.) How to verify whether an addition is overflowed or not?
* Overflow is not considered to be an error in C.
* Thus, we should verify its occurrence with following method.
  * For, x + y = s, 
    * If s >= x, no overflow occurred!
  * why?) x + y >= x.

#### Prop.) Abelian Group structure of the Modular addition
* Def.)
  * It has an identity element 0 and every element has an additive inverse.
  * It is commutative and associative.

</p>

* How?)
  * x = 0 : Trivial. 0 + 0 = 0.
  * Consider that (x + (2^w - x)) % 2^w = 2^w % 2^w = 0.

## 2.3.2 Two's-Complement Addition
* Def.)
  * For a word size _w_, operands x and y such that -2^(w-1) <= x, y <= 2^(w-1)-1

</p>

* How?)
  1. Recall that T2U_x(x) = x_(w-1) * 2^w + x
    * why?) The most significant bit, which was a negative, becomes the positive.
  2. Operating modulo with 2^w.
  3. Then convert unsigned into two's-complement

## 2.3.3 Two's-Complement Negation
#### Prop.) Additive inverse of two's-complement
* For a w-bit integer x, recall that the additive inverse is 2^w - x. ([Check Abelian Group of Unsigned Integers](https://github.com/JoonHyeok-hozy-Kim/computer_systems_study/blob/main/contents/ch_02/notes/03.md#prop-abelian-group-structure-of-the-modular-addition))


#### Prop.) Two's-Complement Negation is identical to addition of additive inverse.

#### Tech.) Bit-level representation of two's-complement negation
* Sol 1) 
  * -x = ~x + 1
* Sol 2)
  1. Let k be the position of the rightmost 1.
  2. Complement each bit to the left of bit position k.
